  <p class="skillDetails">Clicking on the image opens a document that contains an overview of the BABOK model. I created this model to capture the information in the BABOK in an unambiguous and consistent manner. The model can be used to display graphical reoprts of relationships between any of the components in the BABOK, where a component is a task, input or output, technique, stakeholder, guideline or tool.<br>

  <p class="skillDetails">Clicking on the image opens a document that maps BABOK tasks and elements to analysis artifacts and their attributes. The intention of this article is to identify and specify the artifacts listed in the BABOK. These artifacts are listed within the Outputs section of the BABOK tasks. Outputs are described by a paragraph of text within each task. In this article I attempted to expand on these descriptions by adding detail to their content.</p></td>

<p class="skillDetails">Clicking on the image opens a document containing a number of recommendatins for improving my understanding of the BABOK.<br>
These recommendations are the result of creating ad Object-Oriented model which captures the information contained within the BABOK version 3. Types of recommendation include:
<li>Errors or ommissions from the text or diagrams</li><li>Clarifications of ambiguities</li><li>Suggestions that  simplify the reader's understanding, without losing any of the original information</li><br>Let me know what you think or if you have any additions to these suggestions.

<p class="skillDetails">Clicking on the image opens a presentation containing an overview of the Quality with Agile process.<br> 
 After 6 years working as a business analyst on agile projects I decided to document my experience with Scrum in a book titled 'Using Agile In A Quality Driven Environment'. My experience taught me that the Scrum process framework is not the complete story. Scrum does not identify roles for the business analyst, system architect, tester, UI designer or deployment engineers. Instead, the work normally performed by these roles is performed by the development team or the product owner. It is possible that the Scrum development team includes people with all of these skills, but the problem is that all the development team work is performed within a sprint cycle. The only activity that Scrum identifies outside a sprint cycle is maintenance of a product backlog (and even then it is not documented as an activity in the Scrum framework).

This article provides an overview of this book, in which I detail activities that are performed outside the sprint cycle, and identify the benefits that these activities bring to a deliverable product.

The book documents a business analyst's experience with agile projects; Scrum in particular. It describes activities performed outside of the sprint cycle and identifies the benefits and quality that they bring to the implementation of a deliverable product. These activities are captured within a process named Quality With Agile, or QWAP for short. This book documents the QWAP process and how it is applied to Scrum, SAFe and Kanban.</p></td>

        <p class="skillDetails">Clicking on the image opens a copy of my book that can be downloaded for free from lulu.com.<br>
This is a book that I wrote between 2008 and 2011 about requirements analysis using Unified Modeling Language and the software development life-cycle with the Rational Unified Process. The intention is to demonstrate that a RUP-like SLDC with UML, can be performed without having to spend a fortune on expensive UML and software management tools. Instead I translate the procedures and artifacts that I would normally perform using the Rational Analyst Studio Suite, into equivalent artifacts and procedures using MS Office Suite, SharePoint and Visio. It also includes some examples of manging the life-cycle with MS Project. <br>
Since the book was published, MS Visio no longer supports the modeling features that are demonstrated by the process described in the book. The model in this book was created using MS Visio v2007, however there are many other available tools that support this process, for the same cost as Visio or less. Enterprise Architect and Visual Paradigm are 2 common modeling tools that be substituted for Visio 2007.</p></td>

        <p class="skillDetails">The Business Analysts Body of Knowledge is a guide to business analysis, which includes standards, guidelines, tools, activities, techniques and core competencies for business analysts. Version 3 was released in 2015 and expands the scope of business analysis, providing essential direction and support for practitioners in areas such as agile, business intelligence, information technology, business architecture and business process management.
          
          There is a wealth of information contained within this book. It contains a framework of tasks, techniques, guidelines and artifacts, but it is organized in a manner that it makes it difficult to extract only the information that is needed for a specific situation.
          
          Clicking on the BABOK cover image will open a web page which organizes the content of BABOK into a list of artifacts and the techniques, activities, workers, tools and guidelines that are associated with that artifact, allowing the reader to view only the information relevant to their current situation.
